# deadlocked

![downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/avitran0/deadlocked/total?color=blue)

a very simple cs2 aimbot, for linux only

deadlock support will happen once that gets a native linux client

## setup

- add your user to the `input` group: `sudo usermod -aG input USERNAME` (replace USERNAME with your actual username)
- restart your machine (this will ***not*** work without a restart!)

## running

- if you got the source code from github, run with cargo: `cargo run --release`
- if you got a standalone binary, just run that
