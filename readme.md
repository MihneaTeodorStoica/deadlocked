> [!WARNING]
> the features in the unsafe tab are there for a reason.
> do not use them unless you are fine with risking a ban.
> they write to game memory.

> [!CAUTION]
> vacnet 3.0 seems to be better at detecting aimbot and wallhacks, so **do not** use aim lock,
> and play with a low fov to avoid bans. use visuals sparingly.

## faq

### what desktop environments and window managers are supported?

it is tested on GNOME with Mutter, KDE with KWin, and SwayWM.
support for other (especially tiling) window managers is not guaranteed.
if in doubt, use either GNOME or KDE.

### i'm using hyprland and something does not work

too bad, hyprland has bad support for the x11 shenanigans this cheat tries to do.
this is nothing i can fix, and i doubt hyprland will improve its x11 support.

### the overlay window/my screen is black

your compositor or window manager does not support transparency, or it is not enabled.

### the overlay shows up, but i cannot click on anything

the window could not be made click-through, which might be because of window manager/compositor support.

### the overlay does not show up

you window manager does not support positioning or resizing the window.

### the overlay is not on top of other windows

your window manager does not support always on top windows.
